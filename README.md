# PostmanAPI
BDD Cucumber framework for testing Postman API

This test automation framework is created for demo purpose only.

This is a self-practice. This is an API only BDD Cucumber framework to practice API testing.

In this framework I used cucumber-picocontainer dependency for dependency injection, for the purpose of sharing data between step definition files.
